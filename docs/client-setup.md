# MCP Client Setup

RHoiScribe is a local MCP server launched through stdio. It is intended for Codex, Claude Code, and other MCP-compatible clients that can start a local stdio command.

Download a prebuilt binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/czxieddan/RHoiScribe/releases):

- Windows: `rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe`
- Linux: `rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64`
- macOS: `rhoiscribe-macos-universal`

Skill packages are available for agents that can read a local Skill folder:

- Windows: `rhoiscribe-skill-windows-x86_64.zip`
- Linux: `rhoiscribe-skill-linux-x86_64.zip`
- macOS: `rhoiscribe-skill-macos-universal.zip`

Each Skill package contains `SKILL.md` and the matching executable. Use it when you want direct agent access to RHoiScribe prompts, resources, and tools without adding an MCP server entry.

Keep the downloaded file in a stable folder. On Linux and macOS, run `chmod +x` on the downloaded file if the system asks for executable permission.

Build from source only when you want a local Cargo build:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

Use placeholders in docs and committed examples. Replace them only in your private client configuration:

- `<RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>`: absolute path printed by `--print-command`.
- `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RHOISCRIBE>`: absolute path to this repository on the user's machine.
- `<MOD_OUTPUT_ROOT>`: absolute path to a HOI4 mod folder when a generation tool writes files.

Print the command path:

```powershell
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --print-command
```

Linux:

```bash
./rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64 --print-command
```

macOS:

```bash
./rhoiscribe-macos-universal --print-command
```

Direct Skill commands return JSON and expose the same prompts, resources, and tools as the MCP server:

```powershell
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --skill list-tools
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --skill list-resources
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --skill list-prompts
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --skill read-resource "rhoiscribe://hoi4/latest-update"
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --skill call-tool "search_hoi4_knowledge" '{ "query": "on_actions ROOT FROM" }'
```

```bash
./rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64 --skill list-tools
./rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64 --skill list-resources
./rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64 --skill list-prompts
./rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64 --skill read-resource "rhoiscribe://hoi4/latest-update"
./rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64 --skill call-tool "search_hoi4_knowledge" '{"query":"on_actions ROOT FROM"}'
```

MCP server mode keeps CWT language workspaces warm in process memory across tool calls. Direct `--skill` calls expose the same tools and resources, but each command is a short-lived process, so warm CWT state is rebuilt per command instead of reused.

Expected binary paths:

- Prebuilt Windows: `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RHOISCRIBE>\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe`
- Prebuilt Linux: `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RHOISCRIBE>/rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64`
- Prebuilt macOS: `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RHOISCRIBE>/rhoiscribe-macos-universal`
- Local Cargo build on Windows: `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RHOISCRIBE>\target\release\rhoiscribe.exe`
- Local Cargo build on Linux or macOS: `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RHOISCRIBE>/target/release/rhoiscribe`

## Codex

Add RHoiScribe to the Codex MCP server configuration using the release binary as the command.

```toml
[mcp_servers.rhoiscribe]
command = "<RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>"
args = []
```

For Windows TOML strings, escape backslashes or use a path style accepted by your client:

```toml
[mcp_servers.rhoiscribe]
command = "<RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>"
args = []
```

If your Codex surface uses a different config location, keep the same server name, command path, and empty `args` shape.

## Claude Code

Claude Code can register local stdio MCP servers from its MCP configuration or CLI. Use the release binary as the command.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhoiscribe": {
      "command": "<RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

For Windows JSON strings, escape backslashes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhoiscribe": {
      "command": "<RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

CLI-style registration can use the same command path:

```powershell
claude mcp add rhoiscribe -- <RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>
```

## Generic MCP JSON

Many MCP clients accept a server map with `command` and `args` fields:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhoiscribe": {
      "command": "<RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Windows clients usually need the `.exe` path and escaped backslashes in JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhoiscribe": {
      "command": "<RHOISCRIBE_COMMAND>",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Runtime Behavior

- Transport: stdio.
- Network: no runtime network access is required.
- Prompts: available through `prompts/list` and `prompts/get`.
- Resources: available through `resources/list` and `resources/read`.
- CWT resources: `rhoiscribe://hoi4/cwt/catalog` and `rhoiscribe://hoi4/cwt/metadata` describe the pinned NS9927/cwtools-hoi4-config snapshot, revision, hash, virtual source prefix, and no-runtime-disk policy.
- Tools: available through `tools/list` and `tools/call`.
- CWT memory policy: embedded CWT rules are loaded from compiled binary bytes into process memory. RHoiScribe does not extract rule files, create CWT caches, create CWT lock files, or store CWT language state in RNMDB. CWT language tools also skip RHoiScribe tool-call logging so CWT diagnostics and workspace language state are not written to the `.rhoiscribe` log store.
- CWT workspace: call `open_hoi4_language_workspace` with the current mod root early in MCP sessions, then poll `get_hoi4_language_status` until the workspace is warm. Reopen the workspace when the mod root, rules override, vanilla root, ignore globs, or language configuration changes.
- CWT diagnostics: `validate_hoi4_project` defaults to hybrid CWT plus legacy checks. Use `validation_mode = "legacy"` for legacy-only behavior, `validation_mode = "cwt"` for CWT-only behavior, or `validation_mode = "hybrid"` explicitly when you want both.
- CWT file checks: `validate_hoi4_file` validates one saved file or unsaved content with embedded rules and an optional resident workspace handle.
- CWT language intelligence: use `explain_hoi4_diagnostic`, `list_hoi4_workspace_symbols`, `find_hoi4_definition`, `find_hoi4_references`, `suggest_hoi4_completion`, `inspect_hoi4_scope`, and `inspect_hoi4_type_rule` for model-facing explanations, locations, completions, scope context, and applicable rule profiles.
- CWT localisation generation: `generate_missing_localisation` returns reviewable dry-run localisation candidates and generated file content. It never writes files; use `generate_localisation_batch` with the returned entries only after write approval.
- Write mode: generation tools require `dry_run = false` and `output_root = "<MOD_OUTPUT_ROOT>"`.
- Project index: `index_hoi4_project` returns structured definitions, references, and files for a mod root and optional game roots.
- Project validation: `validate_hoi4_project` returns red/yellow/green static checks for CWT schema diagnostics, duplicate IDs, brace balance where CWT parse diagnostics are not available, missing GUI/GFX/localisation links, and `replace_path` risks.
- Repair checks: `repair_hoi4_project` can dry-run or apply UTF-8 BOM rules, Paradox script formatting, and audio checks. If ffmpeg is missing, dry-run returns guidance; after user approval, `dry_run=false` with `install_ffmpeg=true` allows a silent installation attempt.
- Existing-file edits: `edit_hoi4_script_file` replaces or inserts named blocks in an existing HOI4 script file with dry-run preview and brace checks. Pass `workspace_root` for the current mod or workspace so the target file is restricted to that tree.
- Experimental assets: `generate_gui_gfx_asset` can create local procedural PNG files, `.gfx` sprite registration, and optional `.gui` files without external image models. Writing requires `approved=true`.
- Environment discovery: `discover_hoi4_environment` can find `<HOI4_GAME_PATH>`, `game_executable_path`, `<HOI4_DOCUMENT_PATH>`, `error_log_path`, and game version when local HOI4 is installed.
- Debug preflight: `validate_hoi4_debug_run` checks launcher descriptors, playset state, clean document folders, and can optionally launch `hoi4.exe -gdpr-compliant -debug_mode`.
- Rchadow debug launch: `launch_hoi4_debug_with_rchadow` can prepare a debug playset, choose memory or disk mode, and optionally start HOI4 through Rchadow.
- Agent preferences: `list_agent_preferences`, `set_agent_preference`, and `delete_agent_preference` persist cross-IDE habits in an RNMDB-backed `.rhoiscribe` store.
- Tool logs: `query_tool_logs` and `export_tool_logs` read recent tool calls from the same RNMDB-backed `.rhoiscribe` store as agent preferences, with optional regex filtering.
- Log triage: `classify_error_log` groups `error.log` entries by likely HOI4 subsystem and can correlate entries with changed mod-relative paths.

## Direct Log Access

The executable can inspect the same tool logs without starting an MCP session:

```powershell
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --logs "generate_.*"
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --export-logs rhoiscribe-tool-logs.json "error|failed"
```

Linux and macOS use the same arguments on their downloaded binaries.

## Smoke Test

After adding the server to a client, ask the client to list MCP resources and read:

```text
rhoiscribe://hoi4/knowledge/catalog
```

Then call `generate_localisation_batch` with `dry_run = true` before allowing write mode. The returned file path should stay under a valid `localisation/<language>/` tree, including nested subdirectories when they match the user's mod. Filenames use the usual `_l_<language>.yml` suffix, and the encoding should be `utf-8-bom`.

For project-level checks, call `index_hoi4_project`, then `validate_hoi4_project`, then `repair_hoi4_project` with `dry_run = true`. Only use repair apply mode after reviewing the returned changes.

For CWT-backed language support, call `open_hoi4_language_workspace` as soon as the mod root is known, then `get_hoi4_language_status`. Use `validate_hoi4_project` in its default hybrid mode before finishing file-changing work. When validation reports missing localisation, call `generate_missing_localisation` first and review the returned dry-run file before using `generate_localisation_batch` to write approved entries.

For experimental asset generation, call `generate_gui_gfx_asset` with `dry_run = true` first. Set `approved=true` only after the user agrees to create new procedural GUI/GFX assets instead of reusing existing project art.

For local game validation, call `discover_hoi4_environment` first, then pass its returned paths into `validate_hoi4_debug_run` or `launch_hoi4_debug_with_rchadow` with `launch = false`. Only set `launch = true` after the preflight result is green and the user wants RHoiScribe to start the game.
