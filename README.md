If RHoiScribe helps your modding workflow, starring the repository helps other HOI4 mod authors find it.

</div>

RHoiScribe gives Codex, Claude Code, and other MCP-compatible clients a local HOI4 modding reference layer plus tools for generating game-readable files.

The goal is simple: reduce wasted agent work caused by repeated web searches, stale assumptions, unsafe file paths, missing localisation encoding, and Paradox script that looks plausible but does not load in game.

<h2 align="center">Who It Is For</h2>

- Mod authors who want AI agents to generate HOI4 content with better local context.
- Agent workflows that need prompts, resources, and tools available through one MCP server.
- Offline or low-search development sessions where the agent should read bundled HOI4 guidance before writing files.
- Teams that want generated content to follow predictable mod-root paths and reviewable output shapes.

<h2 align="center">What It Provides</h2>

RHoiScribe gives agents a local HOI4 knowledge layer, reusable prompts, and file-oriented tools for common modding work. MCP clients can discover the exact prompts, resources, and tools through the standard MCP list methods after the server is configured.

At a high level, it helps agents with:

- project structure and reference awareness before broad edits
- resident in-memory CWT language checks, symbols, references, completions, and localisation assistance
- red/yellow/green checks for load-risk issues before delivery
- fast encoding, formatting, and media convention checks
- safe edits to existing files while respecting workspace conventions
- Rchadow-assisted HOI4 debug launch preparation
- RNMDB-backed cross-IDE agent state under `.rhoiscribe`
- tool-call audit logs with regex-filtered export from the same state database
- experimental GUI/GFX asset creation when the user approves new procedural art

CWT language support uses a bundled upstream rules snapshot in process memory. It does not require runtime network access and does not extract CWT rules, indexes, diagnostics, or language-service caches to disk.

The bundled Skill package is the quickest way to give compatible agents local access without editing MCP configuration. For complete functionality and a smoother experience, use the MCP server when your agent supports it.

<h2 align="center">Quick Start</h2>

Download a prebuilt binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/czxieddan/RHoiScribe/releases):

- Windows: `rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe`
- Linux: `rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64`
- macOS: `rhoiscribe-macos-universal`

For agents that can read a Skill folder, download the matching Skill package:

- Windows: `rhoiscribe-skill-windows-x86_64.zip`
- Linux: `rhoiscribe-skill-linux-x86_64.zip`
- macOS: `rhoiscribe-skill-macos-universal.zip`

Unzip it into a stable folder. The package contains `SKILL.md` and the matching executable, so an agent can use RHoiScribe directly even when you do not want to configure an MCP server.

Keep the downloaded file in a stable folder. On Linux and macOS, run `chmod +x` on the downloaded file if the system asks for executable permission.

Build from source only when you want a local Cargo build:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

Source builds place the executable under `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RHOISCRIBE>/target/release/`.

Print the command path to use in your MCP client:

```powershell
.\rhoiscribe-windows-x86_64.exe --print-command
```

Linux and macOS users can run the same option on their downloaded file:

```bash
./rhoiscribe-linux-x86_64 --print-command
./rhoiscribe-macos-universal --print-command
```

For Codex, Claude Code, and generic MCP configuration examples, see [docs/client-setup.md](docs/client-setup.md).

<h2 align="center">Help Improve RHoiScribe</h2>

HOI4 syntax and modding practice change over time. If you find bundled knowledge that is outdated, incomplete, or wrong, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/czxieddan/RHoiScribe/issues) with the game version, file type, source reference, and a minimal example when possible.

Pull requests are welcome for expanding the knowledge catalog, improving examples, or building more MCP tools for generation, validation, project scanning, and other agent workflows.
